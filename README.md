- Multiple Pages - Create multiple pages/banks on your controller
- Flexible MIDI Routing - Route MIDI signals between any devices and software
- Configurable - Config file for easy customization
- Auto-Update - Built-in update mechanism via GitHub releases
- REST API (Coming Soon) - Control notes via REST API
